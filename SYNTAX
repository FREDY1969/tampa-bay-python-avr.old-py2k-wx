Singleton words:
    literals
    functions with max arguments == 0 (which includes constants and variables)

foo a b + c is taken as: foo a (b + c), rather than (foo a b) + c

So operators only act on singletons.

Note:
    - don't need (x) without operator before or after
    - (a b) not normally legal as expr

Functions can be turned into singletons by enclosing them in parens:

(foo a b) + c

Or enclosing their argument lists:

foo(a b) + c            # No! (see next issue)

But, then, what is:

foo (a + b) * c ??      # This must be: foo ((a + b) * c)
                        # Unless written without a space between foo and '('?

If foo and bar both take 2 or 3 arguments, what is:

foo a bar b c d         # foo a (bar b c) d or foo a (bar b c d)?

The latter seems right.

Can indenting indicate the end of intermediate parameter lists (where the
NEWLINE (NL) is not preceeded by a ':')?

fun1 fun2 a b           # NL is end of fun2 parameters
     fun3 c d e f       # NL is end of fun3 and fun1 parameters

fun1 fun2 fun3 a b c    # NL is end of fun3 parameters
          d e f         # NL is end of fun2 parameters
     g h i              # NL doesn't end parameters (indent level unchanged)
     j k l m            # NL is end of fun1 parameters

Indenting after ':' has to be 4 spaces (no tabs)
