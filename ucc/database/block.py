# block.py

r'''The helper class for blocks of intermediate code.

A block of code is only entered at the top, and only exited at the bottom.
Thus, there are never any jumps into the middle of a block, or jumps out of
the middle of a block.

The code for each block is represented by a directed acyclic graph whose nodes
are `triple` objects.  This places the least constraints on the order that the
triples must be evaluated in to maximize the ability of the optimizer and code
generator to play games with instruction ordering.  The final assembler code
generation process decides on the final ordering for the triples.
