This talk presents new programming language ideas and new ways to package
traditional compiler technologies to support these ideas. The goal is to take
programming to the next level where we can all write programs about programs
and about programming.
 
These ideas are initially being tested through a compiler targeting the
Arduino microcontroller. This platform provides an ideal microcosm to
"crawl before we walk".
 
Finally, this project is being done as a "hands-on" development exercise by
the Tampa Bay Python meetup group.
 
We will share our ideas and experiences in all of the these areas in this talk.
